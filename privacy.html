            <section>
                <p>Managing panic attacks and anxiety is a journey. Our hope is for Nuvin to be your partner along the way – available to offer support any time, any where, for any reason.</p>
                <p>Any successful partnership needs to start with trust. For this reason, and countless others, we take the privacy of your data seriously.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Nuvin ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you access or use our mobile application ("App"), and when you contact our customer service team or otherwise interact with us.</p>
                <p>Before using the App or submitting any data to Nuvin, please review this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>
                <p>Nuvin is designed with privacy at its core. We collect minimal data, and sensitive information like your mood logs are stored locally on your device, not on our servers.</p>

                <h3>1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
                <p><strong>Mood Tracking Data:</strong> When you use our mood check-in feature, your mood ratings and associated session counts are stored securely in your device's encrypted Keychain. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.</p>

                <p><strong>User Statistics:</strong> We track your usage statistics locally on your device, including total relief sessions completed, current and longest streaks, and your favorite exercises. This data is stored in your device's Keychain and is only accessible by the App on your device.</p>

                <p><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your settings preferences (such as notification times, haptic feedback preferences, and theme choices) are stored locally on your device using standard iOS UserDefaults.</p>

                <p><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> <strong>IMPORTANT: Journal entries are NOT saved.</strong> When you use the Quick Journal feature, your text is displayed temporarily during the 60-second session and is immediately deleted when you complete or exit the session. We do not store, transmit, or have any access to your journal content.</p>

                <h3>1.2 Analytics Data We Collect</h3>
                <p>We use Mixpanel, a third-party analytics service, to understand how users interact with our App so we can improve the experience. Mixpanel collects:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Events:</strong> Actions you take in the App, such as completing a breathing exercise, starting the SOS flow, checking in on your mood, or completing onboarding steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Information:</strong> How long you use the App, which features you access, and how frequently you use the App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model (e.g., iPhone 14), operating system version (e.g., iOS 17.0), and App version.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymous Identifiers:</strong> A randomly generated device ID that does not identify you personally.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What we do NOT collect through analytics:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, precise location, or any personally identifiable information through Mixpanel. Your mood values and journal entries are never sent to Mixpanel.</p>

                <p>You can learn more about Mixpanel's data practices at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/</a></p>

                <h3>1.3 Subscription Data</h3>
                <p>We use RevenueCat, a third-party subscription management service, to process your in-app purchases. When you subscribe to Nuvin Premium, RevenueCat receives:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An anonymous user identifier</li>
                    <li>Your purchase receipt from Apple</li>
                    <li>Your subscription status and type (monthly, annual, or lifetime)</li>
                    <li>Device type and platform (iOS)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Nuvin does not collect, process, or store any credit card or payment information. All payment processing is handled securely by Apple through the App Store. We never see your payment card details.</p>

                <p>You can learn more about RevenueCat's privacy practices at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/</a></p>

                <h3>1.4 Crash & Diagnostic Data</h3>
                <p>If the App crashes or encounters an error, we save a crash log locally on your device. These logs include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Date and time of the crash</li>
                    <li>App version and build number</li>
                    <li>iOS version and device model</li>
                    <li>Technical error information (call stack)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These crash logs are stored locally on your device and are NOT automatically sent to us. They are only used for debugging if you contact our support team and choose to share them.</p>

                <h3>1.5 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                <p><strong>Personalization Data:</strong> During onboarding, you may provide your first name (for in-app personalization), age range, primary reasons for using the App, symptoms you experience, and your wellness goals. This information is stored locally on your device in encrypted Keychain storage and is used solely to personalize your experience within the App.</p>

                <p><strong>Support Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support via email at nathan.douziech@gmail.com, we will receive your email address and any information you choose to include in your message.</p>

                <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>

                <h3>4.1 Where Your Data is Stored</h3>
                <p><strong>On Your Device:</strong> Your mood logs, statistics, preferences, and personalization data are stored locally on your device using iOS Keychain (encrypted) and UserDefaults.</p>

                <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Anonymous analytics data is stored by Mixpanel in the United States. Subscription data is stored by RevenueCat in the United States.</p>

                <p><strong>No Cloud Sync:</strong> Nuvin does not use iCloud or any other cloud service to sync your data. Your data stays on your device unless you explicitly export it.</p>

                <h3>4.2 How We Protect Your Data</h3>
                <p>We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensitive data (mood logs, user stats) is stored in iOS Keychain with encryption</li>
                    <li>All network communications use HTTPS encryption</li>
                    <li>We use anonymous identifiers instead of personal identifiers wherever possible</li>
                    <li>Journal entries are never stored (immediately deleted)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Data Retention</h3>
                <p><strong>Local Data:</strong> Data stored on your device (mood logs, stats, preferences) remains on your device until you delete it manually or uninstall the App.</p>

                <p><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Mixpanel retains analytics data according to their retention policy (typically 5 years, but anonymized).</p>

                <p><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> RevenueCat retains subscription data as long as necessary to provide the service and comply with legal obligations.</p>
