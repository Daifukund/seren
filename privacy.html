                <p>Managing panic attacks and anxiety is a journey. Our hope is for SEREN. to be your partner along the way – available to offer support any time, any where, for any reason.</p>
                <p>Any successful partnership needs to start with trust. For this reason, and countless others, we take the privacy of your data seriously.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how SEREN. ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you access or use our mobile application ("App"), and other online products and services (collectively, the "Service"), and when you contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.</p>
                <p>Before using the Service or submitting any personal data to SEREN., please review this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App or otherwise use the Service.</p>

                <h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect information that alone or in combination with other information in our possession could be used to identify you ("Personal Data") as follows:</p>

                <h3>Personal Data You Provide</h3>
                <p>We collect the following categories of Personal Data from you when you use the Service or communicate with us:</p>

                <p><strong>Identification Data:</strong> We collect your email address (if provided voluntarily), name or nickname you may provide, and unique anonymous identifiers assigned by third-party service providers (such as analytics or subscription management tools). No mandatory account creation is required to use SEREN.</p>

                <p><strong>Anxiety and Mood Tracking Data:</strong> The anxiety check-in and mood tracking features help you measure your emotional state. All of the individual-level data you provide in connection with this feature is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is not transmitted to our servers. We may collect anonymized, aggregated mood trend data (e.g., number of users who reported feeling better after using a technique) through our analytics provider for the purpose of improving our service.</p>

                <p><strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> We collect anonymized information relating to your app usage, such as which features you use (breathing exercises, grounding techniques, SOS flow), session duration, and interaction patterns. This data is collected through our analytics provider Mixpanel to help us understand how users benefit from SEREN and improve the app experience.</p>

                <p><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> When you purchase a subscription through the App, we use RevenueCat to manage your subscription status and entitlements. RevenueCat assigns you an anonymous customer ID that is not linked to your personal identity. We do not collect or process credit or debit card data - all payment processing is handled securely by Apple or Google through their respective app stores.</p>

                <p><strong>Communication Data:</strong> We may collect information when you contact us with questions or concerns through our support email. Providing this information is voluntary.</p>

                <h3>Internet Activity Data</h3>
                <p>When you use the App, we automatically collect certain technical information:</p>

                <p><strong>Device Data:</strong> Device type, operating system version, app version, and unique device identifiers. This information is collected anonymously through Mixpanel.</p>

                <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, such as which features you use, how long you spend in the app, and which techniques you complete. This data is anonymized and used solely to improve the app experience and understand what helps our users most effectively manage anxiety.</p>

                <p><strong>Technical Data:</strong> App crashes, performance metrics, and error logs to help us identify and fix technical issues.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
                <p>We use the following third-party service providers:</p>

                <p><strong>Mixpanel (Analytics):</strong> We use Mixpanel to collect anonymous analytics about how users interact with SEREN. This helps us understand which features are most helpful and where we can improve. Mixpanel may collect device identifiers and usage patterns, but this data is not used for advertising or shared with advertising networks. Learn more at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Mixpanel's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>RevenueCat (Subscription Management):</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions and verify subscription status. RevenueCat assigns anonymous customer IDs and does not collect personally identifiable information. Learn more at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Apple/Google (Payment Processing):</strong> All subscription payments are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. We never have access to your payment card information. Apple and Google may provide us with limited anonymized transaction data (such as subscription type and status) necessary to provide you with the Service.</p>
