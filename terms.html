                <h2>1. GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>

                <h3>1.1 SEREN PRODUCTS</h3>
                <p>These Terms & Conditions (these "Terms") contain the terms and conditions on which we supply content, products or services through our mobile application (the "App") or via other delivery methods to you (the App and such content, products, and services are collectively referred to herein as the "Product" or "Products", which may be updated from time-to-time at the sole discretion of SEREN). Please read these terms and conditions carefully before ordering any Products from the App or third party App stores (e.g. the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, etc.). The terms "SEREN," "us" or "we" refer to SEREN. The term "Device" refers to the device which is used to access the Products including but not limited to computers, smart phones and tablets. The term "you" refers to the user of the Products. When you order ("Order") any Products, or otherwise use or access the Products, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You may also be asked to click "I accept" at the appropriate place prior to your purchase of access to the Products. At such time, if you do not click "I accept", you may not be able to complete such purchase or gain such access. By using the Products, you indicate that you accept these Terms and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree to these Terms, please refrain from using the Products.</p>

                <h3>1.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION / EQUITABLE RELIEF</h3>
                <p>In the event of any dispute arising out of this Agreement, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a settlement in good faith satisfactory to both parties. If they do not reach a solution within a period of sixty (60) days (or such other longer period as the parties may agree), then either party may, on written notice to the other party, refer the dispute for settlement by arbitration before a single arbitrator in accordance with applicable arbitration rules. The costs of the arbitrator will be borne equally by the parties, but they will otherwise bear their respective costs incurred in connection with the arbitration. The parties shall select the arbitrator promptly and use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the arbitration hearing no later than three (3) months after the arbitrator is selected. The arbitrator may not award punitive or exemplary damages against either party or any other relief in excess of the limitations set forth herein. The judgment and award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each party. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of the award and/or an order of enforcement as the case may be. No action, regardless of form, arising out of or in connection with these Terms may be brought by you more than twelve (12) months after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the cause of action, regardless of whether you were aware or ought reasonably to have been aware of the event.</p>

                <p><strong>Equitable Relief:</strong> You acknowledge that any breach of these Terms could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to SEREN that may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that SEREN will have the right to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief in any court having competent jurisdiction over you, to enforce its rights under these Terms, and without showing or proving any actual or threatened damage. This right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies that SEREN may have at law and in equity.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Free Trial:</strong> Subscribers may request a free trial of the Products, which SEREN may grant at its discretion. SEREN may terminate a free trial at anytime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paid Subscription:</strong> a subscription fee-based program, which gives access to all content. You may have access to a free trial period of the subscription program in accordance with certain promotional offers. All subscription services provide access through the Products. You can become a subscriber by purchasing a subscription to the Products from within the App, where allowed by the App marketplace partners. Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Apple's applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. If you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store, the sale is final and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Google's applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds.</li>

                <p>(c) Our "Monthly" subscription is paid in monthly installments. For each month that your monthly subscription is active, you acknowledge and agree that SEREN is authorized to charge the same credit card as was used for the initial subscription fee or other payment method as set forth in section 2.5(h) (the "Payment Method") in the amount of the then current monthly subscription fee. The monthly renewal subscription fees will continue to be billed to the Payment Method you provided, automatically until cancelled. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month's subscription fee to the Payment Method you provided. Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial-month subscription period.</p>

Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial subscription period.</p>

                <p>(e) You may cancel automatic renewals of your subscription at any time by emailing nathan.douziech@gmail.com. Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone application, you may cancel automatic renewals by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your iTunes Account settings and selecting the subscription you want to modify. If you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store you may cancel automatic renewals in account settings under Subscriptions in the Google Play app, or according to the current process outlined by Google Play.</p>

                <p>(f) You agree to promptly notify SEREN of any changes to the Payment Method you provided while any subscriptions remain outstanding. You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions purchased by you.</p>

                <p>(g) In the course of your use of the Products, SEREN and its third party payment service provider may receive and implement updated credit card information from your credit card issuer in order to prevent your subscription from being interrupted by an outdated or invalid card. This disbursement of the updated credit card information is provided to SEREN and SEREN's third party payment service provider at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card issuer.</p>

                <p>(h) Our obligation to provide the Products only comes into being when we take receipt of your Order, and we confirm your purchase to you by email. We shall confirm your Order and send you an email to confirm your access to the subscription purchased. Please quote the Order number in all subsequent correspondence with us. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments on your account. If payment is not received by us from the Payment Method you provided, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.
