                </ul>

                <p>Prices are in U.S. dollars and may vary by region. Prices are subject to change with 30 days' notice.</p>

                <p><strong>No Free Trial:</strong> Nuvin does not currently offer a free trial. Payment is required upfront to access the App.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Payment Processing</h3>
                <p>All payments are processed through Apple's App Store using Apple's in-app purchase system. By subscribing, you agree to Apple's payment terms and conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>We do not collect or process your payment information directly.</strong> Apple handles all credit card, debit card, and other payment method processing. Your payment information is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy, not ours.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Auto-Renewal</h3>
                <p>Monthly and Annual subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</p>

                <p>Your Apple account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.</p>

                <p>Lifetime purchases do not renew and provide permanent access.</p>

                <h3>4.4 Managing Your Subscription</h3>
                <p>You can view, modify, or cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple App Store account:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone</li>
                    <li>Tap your name at the top</li>
                    <li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
                    <li>Select Nuvin</li>
                    <li>Choose "Cancel Subscription" or modify your plan</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You will retain access to the App until that date.</p>

                <h3>4.5 Refunds</h3>
                <p><strong>All sales are final and non-refundable,</strong> except as required by law or as determined by Apple.</p>

                <p>Refund requests must be submitted directly to Apple through the App Store. We do not have the ability to issue refunds for purchases made through Apple's in-app purchase system.</p>

                <p>To request a refund from Apple:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/" target="_blank">https://reportaproblem.apple.com/</a></li>
                    <li>Sign in with your Apple ID</li>
                    <li>Find your Nuvin purchase and select "Report a Problem"</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Apple determines refund eligibility according to their policies. We do not control this process.</p>

                <h3>4.6 Changes to Pricing</h3>
                <p>We may change subscription prices at any time. If we increase the price of your current subscription, we will notify you at least 30 days in advance via the App or email (if provided). The new price will take effect at your next renewal date.</p>

                <p>If you do not agree to a price change, you may cancel your subscription before the new price takes effect.</p>

                <h2>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION</h2>

                <h3>14.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
                <p>If you have a dispute with us, please contact us first at nathan.douziech@gmail.com and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will make good-faith efforts to resolve any disputes amicably.</p>

                <h3>14.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
                <p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally within 60 days, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify</li>
                    <li>Either party may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator.</p>

                <p>Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

                <h3>14.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p><strong>YOU AND NUVIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>

                <p>Unless both you and Nuvin agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</p>

                <h3>14.4 Time Limit for Claims</h3>
                <p>You agree that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the App must be filed within one (1) year after the claim arose. Otherwise, the claim is permanently barred.</p>
